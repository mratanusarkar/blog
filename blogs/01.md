**A Glimpse into the Sky: The Mysteries of Halos**

*Date:* 30/04/2016

The sky, as vast and intriguing as it is, sometimes has the ability to mesmerize us with its phenomena. On this particular day, I witnessed a full round rainbow encircling the sun! I got curious and after a git of googling around, I found that this phenomenon is often referred to as a "Halo." This natural occurrence sparked a series of thoughts and investigations into its origins and implications.

## **Understanding the Halo**

Halos are optical phenomena produced by light interacting with ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere. These result in a variety of colored or white rings, arcs, and spots in the sky. Often observed near the Sun or Moon, halos can sometimes appear elsewhere, or even in the opposite part of the sky. The most commonly recognized halo is the 22° halo.

High cirrus clouds, drifting 20,000 feet or more above us, contain millions of tiny ice crystals responsible for creating halos. They refract and reflect light, causing both the splitting of light and glints of light. For a halo to appear, these crystals must be oriented and positioned precisely relative to the observer’s eye. Thus, halos are a personal experience; everyone sees their unique halo, which is different from someone else's. 

**Fun Fact:** There’s an old weather saying: "a ring around the moon means rain soon." This holds some truth as high cirrus clouds often precede a storm. However, it's worth noting that the sky during halos looks reasonably clear.

### **The Color Spectrum in Halos**

Observing a halo around the moon or the sun reveals certain intriguing characteristics:

- The inner edge of the halo is sharp, while the outer edge is more diffuse.
- Lunar halos are mostly colorless due to the dimness of moonlight. However, it's possible to perceive more red on the inside and more blue on the outside of the halo. This is more evident in halos around the sun. Why? As light rays enter a crystal or droplet, the blue light emerges at a smaller angle than the red light.
- The sky surrounding the halo appears darker than the rest of the sky. This can be due to ice crystal hindrance resulting in a less intense sky area or possibly an optical illusion.

### **The Mystery of Hexagonal Crystals**

One might wonder why ice crystals forming these captivating halos are hexagonal in shape. Nature frequently features hexagonal structures - from honeycomb patterns in beehives to soap bubbles. Hexagonal structures are the most stable in nature and differentiate any area more effectively. This could be the reason behind the formation of hexagonal crystals in the atmosphere, which subsequently results in the halo phenomenon.

Moreover, these hexagonal ice crystals are responsible for creating a circular rainbow, a wonder that led me to dive deeper into the topic. Each crystal acts as a prism, refracting and reflecting light in specific directions based on its shape and orientation.

### **Final Thoughts**

While the halo phenomenon is grounded in scientific explanations, witnessing it firsthand is nothing short of magical. The mysteries of the sky continue to captivate and inspire wonder in us all. And though we've unraveled some of the questions surrounding halos, the sky remains a vast expanse of enigma, waiting for us to look up and question further.
